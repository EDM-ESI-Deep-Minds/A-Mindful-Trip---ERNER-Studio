# A Mindful Journey - ERNER Studio

## Introduction
**A Mindful Journey** is an online multiplayer collaborative board game developed by **ERNER Studio**, inspired by Jumanji. Players embark on an adventure across different biomes, overcoming challenges, answering questions, and strategizing together to reach the center of the map. The game requires teamwork, decision-making, and knowledge to succeed.

## Game Modes
- **Two-Player Mode**: Each player starts with **4 lives**.
- **Three-To-Four-Player Mode**: Each player starts with **3 lives**.
- The goal is to reach the **center of the map** (only one player needs to reach it to win. The center is a hub with shop supplies and it leads to the next environment [level]).
- If a player loses all their lives, the game is lost for all.

## Gameplay Overview
### Starting Conditions
- Players are placed on **randomly chosen predefined starting tiles**.
- Players **choose a character** from a set of 4 characters.
- Each player starts with **300 credits** to buy items from the shop.
- The game features **three levels/biomes**, each with **50-65 tiles** (or an appropriate number for balance).

### Objectives
- **Progress through the levels**: Winning a level moves all players to the next one.
- **Survive and strategize**: Players can cross paths, altering routes and gameplay.
- **Reach the final center**: If at least one player reaches the center, the team wins.
- **Manage resources**: Players can buy items and help each other.

## Level Structure
Each level consists of:
- **Randomized paths** with different tile types.
- **A central hub** at the end of levels 1 and 2 where players can access the **shop**.
- **A shopkeeper NPC** who sells useful items.
- **A progress bar** at the top showing each player's icon and current position.

## Character Set
The game consists of four set players with distinct abilities and bonuses:
- Ren
- Roxy
- Tarus
- Mar

The game also has two important characters:
- Pixie (World Manager, Guide, Question asker)
- Dan (Owner and sole employee of the Dan's Shop chain)

## Player Profile
Each player has a profile containing:
- **Username & ID**
- **ELO Level** (adjusting difficulty dynamically)
- **Total playtime**
- **Games played**
- **Most played character**
- **Best question categories**
- **Worst question categories**

## Movement Mechanics
- Players take turns **rolling a die (or two dice)** to determine movement.
- Landing on different tiles triggers events.

## Tile Types
- **Question Tiles**: Players must answer questions based on their ELO. Categories include Math, Geography, etc.
  - Correct answer: Rewards (extra roll, credits, lives, etc.)
  - Incorrect answer: Penalties (lose lives, move backward, etc.)
- **Bonus Tiles**: Gain an advantage (extra movement, credits, items, etc.).
- **Curse Tiles**: Negative effects (lose movement, lose credits, etc.).
- **Mini-Game Tiles**: Quick challenges for extra rewards.
- **Chance Card Tiles**: Draw a random card that may contain a bonus or a curse.

## Player Interaction & Cooperation
- Players can **help each other** by:
  - Giving lives (only during their turn)
  - Answering questions for another player (if requested)
  - Sharing items or credits
- **Communication**:
  - Players can communicate via **voice or text**.
  - Communication is **disabled on question tiles** so players must answer alone (or request other's help at the cost of the reward).

## Additional Features
- **Mascot Characters**: Guide players through the game, explain rules, and ask questions.
- **Dynamic Background Music**: Changes based on progress and biome.
- **Strategic Road Changes**: Players can switch routes where paths cross.

## Victory & Defeat Conditions
- **Victory**: Any one player reaching the final center wins the game for all.
- **Defeat**: If any player loses all their lives, the game ends in failure.

Feel free to suggest enhancements, additional features, or balance adjustments to improve the experience!
